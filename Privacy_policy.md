# Privacy Policy

This document outlines the privacy policy and agreement that you accept when adding Jeanne (Bot ID 831993597166747679) to a server or as a member of such a server. This document does not supersede the [Developer Terms of Service](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/legal), [Discord's Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms), and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines).

## Data Collection

The main data is stored in an SQLite Database. The data is backed up in case there is a need for changes to prevent loss and damage. It can only be accessed by the bot's developer, [Stacer Varien](https://github.com/Stacer-Varien). In the event of unintentional data loss or alteration, the developer will try to compensate affected users.

User IDs, server IDs, and channel IDs are the main data stored and kept privately in the database. However, they are not always 100% secure. The data is not sold or given to unauthorized 3rd parties unless required by law or the Terms of Service.

The user's or server's data is **not registered** in the database if:

1. The user has not sent a message in the server or is sending messages in ignored channels and direct messages between them and the bot, or in a channel where the bot cannot view.
2. A certain command required to add/enter data in the database has not been used at least once.
3. The user has been banned from using the bot.

## Data Access

Data can be accessed by anyone, but access is limited to everyone except the bot developer, who has full access to all kinds of data. Level and rank data can be accessed freely, but data such as inventory can only be accessed by the main user. Sensitive data, such as message logs, is private or public depending on how authorized personnel deem it, and will only be logged to their own servers.

## Removal of Data

Users are free to request the removal of data by joining the [support server](https://discord.gg/Vfa796yvNq) or by emailing zane544yt@protonmail.com to contact the bot developer with valid reasons.

## Questions

If you have any questions concerning this policy, please feel free to join the server and ask or email zane544yt@protonmail.com.
