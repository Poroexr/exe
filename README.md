Nero is a multipurpose bot with miscellaneous, moderation, management and some fun commands. Later, he will have new commands implemented in the nearby future

FEATURES

• Moderation such as purge, warn, mute, kick, ban and unban

• Create, delete and rename categories, roles and text and voice channels

• Fun commands you can play with

• Getting information of a user and server

• A say command that will make Nero say the message the user wants

PLANNED FEATURES

• Implementing a currency and leveling system that will be global

• Implementing a welcoming, leaving and modlogging system

• Changing role colour

• Changing the server’s name and profile picture

• Editing channel topics

• Adding a softban command that will have the user to be banned for a specific amount of time

• Adding more error messages in case of missing permissions, if a command has been committed poorly and Discord hierarchy rules


KNOWN BUGS AND FAULTS

• Purge for some reason won’t bulk delete messages if a user is mentioned

• Nero will ‘ban’ the user even though they have been banned already instead of raising an error message

• For some commands if poorly executed with a sub-command, it will respond with the main command instead of an error message

• For some reason, ID unbanning a user does not work but will work if the user name and tag has been used (for example, re!unban ZaneRE#1111)

NOTE: THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPORSES. ALSO I WOULD NOT RECOMMENDEND SELFHOSTING THE BOT AS THERE CAN BE CHANGES TO IT SUCH AS ADDING APIS THAT WILL MAKE YOU RUN ALMOST ALL FEAUTURES OF THE BOT
