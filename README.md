Jeanne is a multipurpose bot with miscellaneous, moderation, management and some fun commands. Later, she will have new commands implemented in the nearby future

**FEATURES**

* Available slash commands
* Moderation such as purge, warn, mute, kick, ban and unban
* Create, delete and rename categories, roles and text and voice channels
* Fun commands you can play with
* Getting information of a user and server
* A say command that will make Jeanne say the message the user wants
* A reaction system such as slap, hug and pat

**PLANNED FEATURES**

* Implementing a currency and leveling system that will be global
* Implementing a welcoming, leaving and modlogging system
* Changing role colour
* Changing the serverâ€™s name and profile picture
* Editing channel topics
* Adding a softban command that will have the user to be banned for a specific amount of time

NOTE: THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPORSES. ALSO I WOULD NOT RECOMMENDEND SELFHOSTING THE BOT AS THERE CAN BE CHANGES TO IT SUCH AS ADDING APIS THAT WILL MAKE YOU RUN ALMOST ALL FEAUTURES OF THE BOT
