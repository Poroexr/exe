# Rules of using JeanneBot

**NOTE:** If you are caught violating one of these rules, serious actions such as an XP reset or botban will be made.

> Selfbotting activity

* Selfbotting for intends of farming XP or currency is prohibited. This also includes autotypers, macros or anything that enables automation of commands.

> Use of alt accounts

* There is no limits to the use of alt accounts. However, if you are caught using alts to bypass botbans or farming currency (implemented in the future) and asking to transfer to your alt frequently (such as 'I lost my account password' stories), you will be botbanned.

> Racism, homophobia and sexism

* Using Jeanne to promote racism, homophobia and sexism will not be tolerated!

> Defamation and reputational harm

* Spreading rumours and false reports about Jeanne (such as calling it a nuke bot), me or contributers is punishable.

> Use of illicit tags

* If you are caught using illicit tags while using the NSFW commands (such as using loli, shota, children, etc), it will result in an immediate botban.

# Harassment Policy

All kinds of harassment will not be tolerated. This includes attacking contributors to stop helping or me to stop working on the bot. If you harass the contributors and myself, severe punishments will be made such as:

* Immediate botban (both you and your server)
* Reported to Discord or any soical media platform if we have reportable objects
* Jeanne will be removed from your server (I will force her to leave the server but if you bring her back, the botban will take effect and she will not collect ANY data from it)
