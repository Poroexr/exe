# Rules of using JeanneBot

**NOTE:** If you are caught violating one of these rules, serious actions such as an XP reset or botban will be made.

> Selfbotting activity

* Selfbotting for intends of farming XP or QP is prohibited. This also includes autotypers, macros or anything that enables automation of commands.

> Use of alt accounts

* There is no limits to the use of alt accounts. However, if you are caught using alts to bypass botbans or farming currency and asking to transfer to your alt frequently (such as 'I lost my account password' stories), you will be botbanned.

> Racism, homophobia and sexism

* Using Jeanne to promote racism, homophobia and sexism will not be tolerated!

> Defamation and reputational harm

* Spreading rumours and false reports about Jeanne (such as calling it a nuke bot), causing unwanted drama or attacking me or contributers and Jeanne is punishable.

> Use of illicit tags

* If you are caught using illicit tags while using the NSFW commands (such as using loli, shota, children, etc), it will result in an immediate botban.
