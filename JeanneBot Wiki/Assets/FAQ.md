So I guess some people will ask me about why I took 19 days to update Jeanne when the bot needed immediate fixes on some commands. I have been planning to do that however there were a lot of backlogs that delayed it. I will explain that later but now, its FAQ time before I will be asked the same questions over and over.

> QUESTION: I added '02' as a tag for the yandere command but I got a 'blacklist message' but not from the gelbooru or danbooru command. Why?

* ANSWER: I blacklisted that tag on the yandere command because it returned guro and extreme content that is not very safe. It is the only tag that has its own error message other than loli, ugly bastard or shota that have the same 'blacklist' message. To be honest, I thought 02 would return the 02 character from Darling in the Franxx.

> QUESTION: Why did it take you 19 days to update Jeanne?

* ANSWER: There were a lot of backlogs that prevented me to work on Jeanne or do minor fixes. I have planned to complete it in less than 3 days. However, it took almost 7 times longer.

* The 1st backlog was my workplace. I spend 7 to 8 hours per day working but most of the time, it gets quiet to I can do some random stuff whle waiting for customers. The past 19 days showed a lot of activity at work that I barely had time to rest (such as people looking around and assisting them, being extra vigilant as there are loiters checking the shop and waiting for an opening to steal something). This has happened after the opening of SAYouth posts and SARS tax registering. You might think that is very easy to do, right? Wrong! Most of the time, customers take almost 3 to 7 minutes looking around in the shop and I have to stand by the door and watch if they are taking something, they make irrational changes while I am working on their CVs or letters which forces me to retype sometimes the whole thing, missing documents for the SAYouth or SARS, harassed by many customers for 'bad service' on their SARS registration (first, SARS is owned by the government. I do not work with them in any way or form. Second, if they are missing the required documents, then they will not qualify for the registration and they will go mad or talk senselessly not understand that they are missing something) and most of them threatened to get me fired for lying about that there is no jobs in my workplace (there is not enough money to hire another person as it is just only me, my boss and his wife in this area).

* The 2nd backlog is exams. I am on my 3rd year about to go to my 4th year and exams has been putting a toll on me. Although I am almost done, my exams are about almost 3 months long. Each paper is about 2 to 4 hours long except one which I finished that had a 24 hour time limit. During that time of exams, I might lose focus on fixing Jeanne yet I was aware of the faults.

* The 3rd backlog is Sunday. Sunday is my free day... from work, not house work. Every Sunday, I am told to do this, do that, paint this, cut this, go out totown and buy this and when its done, I usually play games to finally catch a breather. This is the only day of the week that I wish I have a full break but there is always something that I would be told to do.

* The 4th backlog and this is the worse enemy of South Africa including myself, loadshedding. Loadshedding is very familiar here since late 2008. It involves schedule blackouts that would last about +/- 6 hours per day depending on the stage it is set on. Now at this year, internet connect gets knocked out whenever loadshedding starts and without it, it would be impossible to test the fixes and new commands and I mostly do them on a PC. Even though  have a notebook, again, same story. There are some cases that the area should be having power back after the time of loadshedding ends. However, it could go from 2 hours, to almost 10 hours which is the worst case scenario that could happen.

> QUESTION: Do you care about your reputation in Discord? Like, I have heard that you were falsely reported multiple times.

* ANSWER: Personally, I don't give 2 shits about my reputation. But as a bot developer of Jeanne, I have to protect her reputation as someone accused her of being a raid/nuke bot. So keep damaging my reputation as much as you like but I will be defending Jeanne to protect her image.

> QUESTION: Why are you still using discord.py when it will retire on April 2022? You know that library doesn't have a slash command package, right?

* ANSWER: I am aware of that and yes, I do know that it doesn't have a slash
package. But I am using the unstable packages that might continue Jeanne's
lifetime in Discord as she has the dpy-interactions package installed. But
there would be a time when I will use discord.js for Jeanne in the nearby future.

> QUESTION: Why can you selfhost Jeanne?

* ANSWER: With loadshedding and internet gets knocked during loadshedding? No.
