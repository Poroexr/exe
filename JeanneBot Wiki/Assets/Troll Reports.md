Alright, so there is a reason why the report command was disabled after the v2.9.2b update and then enabled after the v3.0 update. While during v2.9.2a, there was a report that came about Jeanne but I ignored it as it was a troll but... they started to build-up...

What was that troll report you may ask? Well, this shit:

Yep, not lying... Some sick minded assfucks are asking for child p**n and loli/shota hentai and the biggest problem of all is that I do not have the user IDs, meaning I don't know who are those people which is making it worse that I cannot botban them.

#Didn't you try email requirement?

Yes, I did. But...

And I highly doubt the `42069@suckmycock.com` is a real email address or `suckmycock.com` is a real domain and also, I had lost all complete trust on Google Forms checking legit emails.

#So what will you do?

Well, I've already said that I will disabled until the v3.0 update comes. As of now, I am going to use the webhook method to capture the reporter's IDs including their names and unlike the Google Form report (which I'm going to delete after v3.0), it will make it easier for me to botban them.

#But do you know who may be doing this?

I may be suspecting users whom I may have botbanned before and/or using alt accounts are trolling the report form for asking for child p**no and/or loli/shota hentai.

These are the users whom I'm suspecting:

These users may be suspected of doing those reports. The dickhead named `Stone` has done the most damage and as for the bitch named `Saisha` harassed one of the testers that he left Discord for good (he deleted his account) and she has 5+ accounts, meaning she can do more block evasion which is against the Discord ToS.
