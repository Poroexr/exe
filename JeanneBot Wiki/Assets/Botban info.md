# About botban

Botban means that you are banned from using Jeanne and all commands are rendered useless to you.

> How does one gets botbanned?

* **ANSWER:** As seen in [rules](https://github.com/Varien-1936/Jeanne-Bot/blob/main/JeanneBot%20Wiki/Rules.md), if someone was caught or reported for breaking the rules depending on the seriousness of it, they will be botbanned. The commands will be rendered usesless to them as they will recieve a hidden message saying that they are botbanned with a reason. All their data such as XP that was collected and stored in the database except warnings that they have will be deleted. I do not care how much work and effort they made. It is their fault that they have broken the rules.

> If someone gets botbanned, can they appeal for it?

* **ANSWER:** I am not a very forgiving man so when someone is botbanned, they are botbanned **PERMANENTLY!** They will have no chance of appealing their botbans.

> If someone is botbanned, can they report any bug, faults, exploits or someone breaking the rules they have seen?

* **ANSWER:** It will depend on the accuracy of the report.

> Will they be a chance that my botban will be revoked?

* **ANSWER:** NEVER! Even if they stopped using Discord, they will never be unbanned.
