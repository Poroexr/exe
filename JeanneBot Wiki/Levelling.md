# Levelling

**NOTE:** The system is incomplete yet operational.

>**How to gain experience**

* You gain experience by sending a message. Right now, the system is incomplete but there will be changes. For now, you gain 5XP/2 Minutes/Message meaning if you send a message now, you will gain 5 but you have to wait for 2 minutes to gain another 5 XP on the next message.

* In the nearby future, there will be a member count requirement for members to gain XP ([click here to read more about it](https://github.com/ZaneRE544/ZaneRE544/blob/main/2022%20plans.md)).

>**Level**

* See your level or someone's level
    Example: `/level` (if yourself) / `/level MEMBER` (if for a member)

>**Rank**

* Check who is the top 10 users of the server. You might be lucky if your name shows
* **NOTE:** You will be given 2 options whether to see the server or global rank.

    Example: `/rank SERVER` (if you just want the server rank) / `/rank GLOBAL` (if for everyone stored in the XP data)
