# Levelling

**NOTE:** The system is incomplete yet operational.

>**How to gain experience**

* You gain experience by sending a message. Right now, the system is incomplete but there will be changes. For now, you gain 5 XP/Message but in the future, it will be 5XP/1 Minute/Message meaning if you send a message now, you will gain 5XP but you have to wait for 1 minute to gain another 5 XP on the next message.
* Your XP is guild specific but I will make a global XP

* In the nearby future, there will be a member count requirement for members to gain XP ([click here to read more about it](https://github.com/ZaneRE544/ZaneRE544/blob/main/2022%20plans.md)).

>**Level**

* See your level or someone's level
    Example: `/level` (if yourself) / `/level MEMBER` (if for a member)

>**Rank**

* Check who is the top 10 users of the server. You might be lucky if your name shows

    Example: `/rank`
