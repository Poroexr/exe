Before inviting Jeanne into the server, make sure she has the following permissions enabled:

**Main Permissions**

* Jeanne needs the `send messages`, `embed links`, `attach files` and `use application commands` permissions to be enabled as almost all of the responses are in embed. She also needs the `attach files` permission in case I make a command that requires it. The `use application commands` allows her to have slash commands installed in the server.

**Moderation Permissions**

* The `manage messages` permission allows Jeanne to delete messages if a `purge` command has been used. 
* The `kick members` permission allows Jeanne to warn, mute, unmute and kick members. 
* The `ban members` permission allows Jeaane to ban and unban members.

**Manage Role Permission**

* This permission is required allow Jeanne to manage roles such as making new roles, deleting roles and renaming roles. This is also required since the `muterole` command requires this permission. If someone uses the `mute` command and a mute role doesn't exist, she will not mute the user.

**Manage Channel Permission**

* This command is needed if to manage voice channels, text channels and categories.

**Manage Nicknames Permission**

* I have plans to allow users to change their own nicknames with Jeanne or anyone who has the `manage nicknames` permission can change other user's nicknames.
