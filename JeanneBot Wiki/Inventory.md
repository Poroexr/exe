* **NOTE:** The custom background picture you wish to buy must have a 9:5 ratio and for better quality, must be at least 900x500 resolution. You must use a VALID image URL for it as long as it is permanent. If the background is NSFW or violates ToS, it will be removed with NO REFUND, that includes the name that you have set.
